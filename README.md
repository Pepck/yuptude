yuptude is a tiny bookmarklet that you can use to speed up or slow down HTML5 videos in your browser.  When activated, yuptude adds a small control panel that you can use to manually adjust the playbackRate for all videos on the current page.

It works on many popular sites across the web: Vimeo, Netflix, YouTube, Ted, Facebook, and many many others.  Use it to watch presentations in a fraction of the time or experiment to find other amusing applications.

And if you discover something fun or useful, share it with me at [@saypepck](https://www.twitter.com/saypepck) on Twitter.

## building yuptude

yuptude uses the [bookmarklet NodeJS module from mrcoles](https://github.com/mrcoles/bookmarklet) to package itself for use as a bookmark.
